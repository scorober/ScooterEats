Programmed in Android Stuido with min SDK = API 24 and Target = API 28.

Add a local sqlite database using the Room Persistence Library. So far just implemented the Users table to allow users to be saved and verified.  Our group doesn't have much experience with Android Studio so the code may be a little messy. I found myself starting something, then realizing the tutorial was five years old and moved on to something else.  

I modeled the package structure with the Model-View-Presenter architecture in mind.  I hope that helps being able to pick up this project and read my code.

For busy work for the next sprint, a lot of user input still needs to be validated in the login and registration activities.  Repositories need to be made for the databases and relations for ordering should be added.  I updated the TODOs in the project to give a general idea of where work needs to be done.
